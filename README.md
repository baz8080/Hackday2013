===========

Some EditText subclasses that I made in Distilled Media's HackDay in 2013.

## EmailAddressAutoCompleteTextView

An EditText that will enumerate the users' known accounts and set up an auto-complete adapter filled with their email addresses.

## PhoneNumberEditText

This EditText will validate phone numbers. The expected country code can be supplied from xml.

## ValidatingEditText

EditText field that will perform validation based on a regex that is specified in xml.
